# text-wrap-probe fixture

Synthetic repro for the Chromium-vs-Figma wrap-point divergence tracked
in `openspec/changes/fix-html-converter-figma-fidelity/` (Phase 2).

## What this is

Three slides, each a two-column flex layout with four paragraphs per
column, rendered at Inter 24 px / 16 px / 32 px. Each paragraph opens
with a styled bold label so the run structure matches the real-world
cases where the bug has shown up.

The fixture is committed so every contributor can reproduce the same
convert-html output without needing access to any private deck. It is
deliberately content-free: no client names, no real UXR material.

## Regenerate

```
node build-fixture.mjs
```

Regenerate after editing paragraphs, font size, column widths, or the
font source. The generator writes `text-wrap-probe.html` in this
directory.

## Swapping the Inter source

Phase 2 compares Chromium's wrap points across three Inter candidates:

1. **Google Fonts CSS2 Inter WOFF2** — the default. See `FONT_CSS` at the
   top of `build-fixture.mjs`.
2. **Rasmus Andersson's official Inter release** — replace `FONT_CSS`
   with an `@font-face` block pointing at a local or CDN copy of the
   static or variable WOFF2.
3. **Claude Design's bundled Inter** — copy the relevant `@font-face`
   block from a real Claude Design standalone HTML export (anywhere in
   this repo's committed fixtures will do) and replace `FONT_CSS` with
   that block.

After each swap, regenerate and re-run convert-html to observe wrap
points.

## Running the probe

```
node bin/cli.mjs convert-html \
    test/fixtures/standalone-html/text-wrap-probe/text-wrap-probe.html \
    -o /tmp/probe.deck
```

Open `/tmp/probe.deck` in Figma, paste the same paragraphs into a fresh
Figma deck at the same widths as a control, and compare wrap points.

When `convert-html --dry-run` lands (Phase 2 task 2.2), run with that
flag instead — it writes the intermediate manifest without emitting a
`.deck`, and the per-paragraph `height` values directly reveal Chromium's
wrap counts for side-by-side inspection.
