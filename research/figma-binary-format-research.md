## 1. Figma File Format Reverse Engineering

### File Structure

Figma `.fig` (and `.deck`) files are ZIP archives containing a `canvas.fig` binary payload plus metadata. The binary payload uses the **Kiwi** serialization format, created by former Figma CTO Evan Wallace. Kiwi is similar to Google's Protocol Buffers but simpler, with more compact encoding and better support for optional fields.

**Binary layout of `canvas.fig`:**
```
[header:8 "fig-kiwi"][version:4][schema_chunk_length:4][schema_chunk][data_chunk_length:4][data_chunk]
```

- **Chunk 1 (Schema):** Deflate (zlib) compressed. Contains the Kiwi schema definition (~24KB compressed → ~59KB decompressed). This schema defines all type definitions used in the file.
- **Chunk 2 (Data):** Zstandard (zstd) compressed. Contains the actual document data (~2.3MB compressed → ~29MB decompressed for a typical file).

The schema is embedded in the file itself, which is critical — it means the schema can (and does) change between Figma versions.

**File type signatures:**
- `fig-kiwi` — Standard Figma design files
- `fig-makee` — Figma Make files
- `.deck` files — Figma Slides (ZIP archive with similar internal structure)

### Key Libraries/Tools for Decoding

- **pako** — Deflate decompression for schema chunk
- **fzstd** — Zstandard decompression for data chunk
- **kiwi-schema** — Kiwi binary format decoder
- **fig-kiwi** (npm) — Community package that reads/writes .fig files with TypeScript definitions derived from the kiwi schema

**CLI decoding example:**
```bash
node cli --schema figma.kiwi --root-type NodeChanges --to-json simple.fig
```

### Root Data Structure

The root type in Figma's kiwi schema is **`NodeChanges`**, which contains:
- `nodeChanges` — An array of node change records (NOT a tree — must be converted to a tree structure by matching parent/child relationships)
- `blobs` — Binary data for commands, vector networks, images, etc.

Key fields in NODE_CHANGES include: `type`, `sessionID`, `ackID`, `pasteID`, `pasteFileKey`, `pasteIsPartiallyOutsideEnclosingFrame`, `pastePageId`.

The schema reportedly contains **534+ type definitions** covering nodes, colors, vectors, transforms, fonts, and more.

## 2. Figma Component Model — Internal Structure

### Component/Instance System

Figma's component system uses the following node types internally:
- **COMPONENT** (historically called `SYMBOL_MASTER`) — The main component definition
- **COMPONENT_SET** — A container for variants of a component
- **INSTANCE** — A copy of a component that stays linked to the main component

### Instance-Component Linkage

Instances maintain a reference to their main component via:
- **`componentId`** — For local components (same file), stores the node ID of the main component
- **`componentKey`** — For library components (external files), stores a unique key

These identifiers persist even after the component is deleted, enabling the "Restore Component" functionality.

### Override System

Overrides are stored as **deviations from the main component's properties** on the instance node. Key aspects:

- **`overriddenFields`** — An array listing which fields have been directly overridden on an instance (inherited overrides are NOT included)
- **Override matching** uses **layer names** as the primary key — when swapping variants or instances, Figma preserves overrides only if layer names match between the source and target
- **Override hierarchy:** Figma also checks if the layer hierarchy path is similar when matching overrides

**Supported override properties:**
- Text content, font, weight, size, line height, letter spacing
- Fill/stroke (type, value, opacity)
- Shadow and blur effects
- Layout guides
- Nested instance swaps
- Export settings
- Layer names

**NOT overridable** (structural changes that force detachment):
- Layer order (z-index)
- Layer positioning within the component
- Constraints
- Text layer bounds

### Component Properties

Component properties use a naming convention with `#` suffixes for disambiguation:
- `propertyName#uniqueID` for TEXT, BOOLEAN, and INSTANCE_SWAP properties
- VARIANT type properties are prioritized in case of name collision

### The `nodeChanges` Array (Binary Format)

In the binary format, the document is stored as a flat array of `nodeChanges`, NOT as a tree. Each node change contains the node's properties and a reference to its parent. The tree must be reconstructed by matching parent-child relationships. This is important for component manipulation — you must maintain correct parent references.

## 3. Known Issues with External Figma File Manipulation

### Override Corruption Patterns

Community reports consistently describe these failure modes:

1. **Override loss on variant swap** — When layer names differ between variants, all overrides are silently dropped. This is by design but catches tool authors off-guard.

2. **Nested component override loss** — Overrides are lost at second-level nesting. Nested components using slots lose overrides when variables are involved.

3. **Component links breaking after import** — When .fig files are imported to a new account or duplicated, component connections and variable references can break entirely.

4. **"Component Broken - Click to Fix"** — A persistent bug where instances appear visually broken but clicking into them temporarily fixes the issue. The corruption returns after file reload.

5. **Branch merge corruption** — Branch merges have been reported to break ALL component instances across working files, with conflict errors on every instance that cannot be resolved by restore & republish.

6. **Library publish breaking overrides** — Publishing library updates can cause downstream files to lose border radius, alignment, and layer name overrides.

### Specific Risks for External Tool Authors

- **Schema version drift** — The kiwi schema changes between Figma versions without notice. A tool that works today may silently corrupt files tomorrow.
- **Flat array reconstruction** — The nodeChanges array must be correctly reconstructed; any error in parent-child relationships will corrupt the document tree.
- **Blob index integrity** — Properties like `commandsBlob` and `vectorNetworkBlob` reference blob indices. Modifying the blob array without updating these indices corrupts vector data.
- **ID uniqueness** — Node IDs (e.g., "75:127") must remain unique. Duplicating nodes without generating new IDs causes undefined behavior.

## 4. Figma's Official Documentation on Component Integrity

### Detachment
- Detaching an instance **permanently breaks** the link to the main component
- Once detached, it cannot be re-linked automatically — you must replace it with a fresh instance
- `DetachedInfo` persists even after deletion, containing either `{type: 'local', componentId}` or `{type: 'library', componentKey}`

### Restore Component
- If a main component is deleted but instances remain, selecting an instance shows a "Restore Component" option in the right sidebar
- This recreates the main component from the instance's stored data
- Plugins cannot access this "restore" functionality — they can only recreate components and swap instances manually

### Override Preservation Rules (Official)
Figma uses two criteria to determine override preservation:
1. **Layer name matching** — Layer names must match between current and target instance/variant
2. **Property equality check** — When selecting variants, Figma checks if the changed properties originally matched between variants. If they did, overrides are preserved.

## 6. Best Practices for Maintaining Component Integrity

Based on the collective findings from all sources above, here are the critical rules for programmatically modifying Figma files:

### MUST preserve:
1. **Node IDs** — Every node has a unique ID (e.g., "75:127"). These MUST remain unique and consistent. Component-instance links depend on them.
2. **Component references** — `componentId` (local) and `componentKey` (library) fields on INSTANCE nodes must point to valid COMPONENT nodes.
3. **Layer names** — Override matching depends entirely on layer name consistency. Changing a layer name in a component will cause all instances to lose overrides for that layer.
4. **Parent-child relationships** — The flat `nodeChanges` array must reconstruct to a valid tree. Orphaned nodes or circular references will corrupt the file.
5. **Blob indices** — `commandsBlob`, `vectorNetworkBlob`, and similar fields reference indices into the blobs array. Any modification to the blob array must update all references.
6. **Schema consistency** — The schema chunk must match the data chunk. Modifying data fields without understanding the schema definition will produce invalid files.

### SHOULD preserve:
7. **Node type consistency** — Don't change a node's type (e.g., COMPONENT → FRAME). This will break instance links.
8. **Override sticker data** — Instance overrides are stored as stickers/deltas. Modifying the component structure without updating stickers can cause visual corruption.
9. **Session/version metadata** — The `sessionID`, `ackID` fields in NodeChanges relate to Figma's multiplayer sync. While not strictly required for local files, corrupting these may cause issues when reopened in Figma.

### AVOID:
10. **Empty strings** — Never use empty string `""` for text content. Use a single space `" "` instead. Empty strings crash Figma.
11. **Overwriting source files** — Always write to a new output path. If the write fails mid-stream, you lose both source and output.
12. **Assuming schema stability** — The kiwi schema is an unstable internal implementation detail. Any field could change, be removed, or be reinterpreted in a new Figma version.
13. **Creating new SYMBOL/COMPONENT nodes** — Use existing template components. Creating components from scratch requires getting many interdependent fields exactly right.

### Key Insight: Override Matching Path

The most critical (and least documented) aspect is how Figma resolves override paths within instances. Overrides are matched by:
1. **Layer name** (primary key)
2. **Hierarchy position** (secondary key — the path through the node tree)
3. **Property type** (which specific property is overridden)

When cloning slides or manipulating component instances externally, the override matching path must be preserved exactly. This means:
- Don't rename layers within components
- Don't reorder layers within components
- Don't add/remove intermediate container layers
- Don't change the nesting depth of overridden layers

## Summary of Gaps in Public Knowledge

1. **The complete kiwi schema is not publicly documented.** While the schema is embedded in every .fig file and can be extracted, Figma has never published an official schema reference. The schema has 534+ type definitions.

2. **Component override storage internals** (symbolData, guidPaths, override stickers) are not documented anywhere publicly. These terms appear in decoded .fig files but their exact semantics are only known to Figma engineers.

3. **No official specification exists** for what constitutes a "valid" .fig file. There are no validation tools or conformance tests.

4. **The format is explicitly unstable** — Figma reserves the right to change it at any time. The online parser by Evan Wallace carries this warning prominently.

5. **No public documentation on `.deck` file specifics** — While `.deck` files share the same binary format, any Slides-specific node types or properties are undocumented.
